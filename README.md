Chikopedia:

We, as pokemon lovers, are creating an application that mimics the pokedex, such that the users are able to search for pokemon information and to record the pokemon the users have caught so far

Features include:

- Being able to search pokemon by pokemon id or name
- Seeing all of the pokemon through the grid view
- Pokemon are clickable through the grid and takes you to the Pokemon Pokedex Entry
- In Pokedex Entry there is a Carousel feature that lets you go to prev or next Pokemon Pokedex Entry
- In Menu there is a livingDex toggle that allows you to save the pokemon you caught in the grid view
- Grey pokeball means you dont have it and red means you do
